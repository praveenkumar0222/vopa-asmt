#--->>>. Finding top 11 horses from the 144 horses   <<<---


we split the 144 horses in 12 groups, where each group contains 12 horses.
Each group will be raced and the 1st among each group will be selected  for next race (12 races).
All the winners from all group will be raced to find the 1st among all the group. (13th race).

Now the remaining 11 horses from the winers race and one extra 2nd place horse from the group of the top 2nd horse  from the winners race will be added .

why the 2nd place horse and why only from the 2nd winner horse group ?
the reason is the 2nd placed horse from the 2nd winner group is, this Group seem tough .
Because it was the second from the group where the top 2nd is also the second from the winners group. This makes that the horse from the group has potential.

now the last race (14 th race contains, all the horses from the 13 th race except the 1st from that race + this 2nd placed horse from the 2nd placed winners group) will be conducted , where we will select only the top 10 horses.

at last we will get the 10 horses from the 14th race and the 1 horse from the 13th race, which will give the top 11 horses from the 144 horses.
